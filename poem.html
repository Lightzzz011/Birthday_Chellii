  <h1>Poem for You, Chelli!</h1>

  <div class="poem">
    She’s roll number 26, I’m 27 just numbers, but everything we share is more.
    In class, we’re quiet, our own little world where we feel understood,
    Only comfortable when it’s just us and our best friends.
    She’s only noisy around me where she can truly be herself,
    No need to pretend...

    She loves biryani, but never completes one.
    We match in the simplest ways, the way we try to keep life simple,
    Even the way we study, it all feels the same, like we’re two halves of one whole.

    Our hearts are small, but they feel everything
    Every shout, every word that stings, we carry it together.
    She’s cute, kind, and when she hurts, I hurt too.

    She looks like a cat, soft, sweet, with that same quiet strength,
    And I gifted her a cat necklace, a token of the love that’s pure and true.
    She tied me a rakhi, our bond tied in the threads of care.

    She sleeps a lot, but when she’s awake, she’s all the energy we need,
    And in everything, we just click...
